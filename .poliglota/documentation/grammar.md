## Root Repository
> Refers to the [root](../../) of Github/Local repository.

Is Where the folders
[`.plugins`](../../.plugins) [[#1](#plugins)],
[`.poliglota`](../../.poliglota) [[#2](#poliglotas-internal-folder)],
[`.templates`](../../.templates) [[#3](#templates-folder)] and
[`repository`](../../repository) [[#4](#main-repository)]
are located.

## Main Repository
> Refers to [`repository/` Folder](../../repository/)
> at the [Roor Repository](#root-repository).

Is where you'll put your *[Projects](#projects)*


## Project
> Refers to your projects inside of [Main Repository](#main-repository).

Is where you'll add and write your *[Implementations](#implementations)*


## Implementations
> Refers to each implementation of a [Project](#project).

A implementation is a Project rewrite, it can be
in some specific language, framework, code-style, algorithm,
it means, different ways to generate the same result.

With these implementations,
you can understand better your distinct tools.

Remember, not only frameworks are tools,
but also languages are.


## Template's Folder
> Refers to [`.templates` folder](../../.templates)

Is where you'll add your own
[Implementation's Templates](#implementations-template)
based on a [Base Template](#base-template)

## Implementation's Templates
> Refers to templates inside [`.templates` folder]> (../../.templates)

Are the templates that will be used to generate your
[Project](#project)'s [Implemantations](#implementations).
They are builtin using a [Base Template](#base-template)


## Base Template
> Refers to [`.template/` folder](../../.templates/.template)
> inside of [`.templates` folder](../../.templates).

Is used to generate your new
[Implementation's Templates](#implementations-templates)


## Plugins
> Refers to [`.plugins` folder](../../.plugins)

Is where additional features are added.

## Poliglota's Internal Folder
> Refers to [`.poliglota` folder](../../.poliglota)

Is where internal things of this project are placed.

This folder is composed by a
[`documentation` folder](../documentation) (where is
placed the documentation of this project)
and a [`scripts` folder](../scripts) (where is placed
the commands that powers poli script).
