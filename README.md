# Poliglota

A minimalist tool to learn to programming

> Poliglota is a new way to learn new programming languages
> (or patterns/strategies/frameworks...) with already known.
> This tool gives you *flexibility* and *agility*
> to implement new learning projects.

## Methodology
The idea is quite simple,
implement learning projects in different languages.
Then, take notes about what you learnt in `notes.md`,
and finally, compare the difference between them
and do different approachs to resolve the same problem/challenge.

## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Have bash on your global path
- Install [Arturo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo#installation)
on your global path

> Currently, you need bash since some functions are depending on it.
> It can be changed on future

## Basic Commands

```bash
# create a new project with every template available
$ ./poli new <project>

# add a specific implementation to a project
$ ./poli add <template> <project>

# fill a project with not implemented templates
$ ./poli fill <project>

# get a complete help
$ ./poli --help
```
