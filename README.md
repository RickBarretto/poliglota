# Poliglota -- Purpose

[ ⚠️WIP: Working in Progress]

---
This is a purpose project yet.
So, it's not a complete project
and things may change until a stable version.

Read the [`todo.md`](./todo.md).

A minimalist tool to learn to programming

> Poliglota is a new way to learn new programming languages
> (or patterns/strategies/frameworks...) with already known.
> This tool gives you *flexibility*, *agility* and *extensibility*
> to implement new learning projects.

## Methodology
The idea is quite simple,
implement learning projects in different languages.
Then, take notes about what you learnt in `notes.md`,
and finally, compare the difference between them
and do different approachs to resolve the same problem/challenge.

With *minimalist*, means that Poliglota is just a repository with
a defined structure (you can change it)
and a script called `poli`. (Really, just it!)

Thus, without a philosopy or methodology behind,
you can just change whatever you want, being *extensible*
Feel free and have fun!

> Please, read the complete documentation before start.

## Básico

### Add new languages support

```shell
$ ./poli templ add python
$ ./poli templ add c
$ ./poli templ add arturo
$ ./poli templ list
arturo
c
python
```

### Create new projects

```
$ ./poli proj add 15_puzzle_game
$ ./poli proj add todo_app
$ ./poli proj list
15_puzzle_game
todo_app
```
