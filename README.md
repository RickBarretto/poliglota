# Poliglota -- Purpose

[ ⚠️WIP: Working in Progress]

---
This is a purpose project yet.
So, it's not a complete project
and things may change until a stable version.

A minimalist tool to learn to programming

> Poliglota is a new way to learn new programming languages
> (or patterns/strategies/frameworks...) with already known.
> This tool gives you *flexibility* and *agility*
> to implement new learning projects.

## Methodology
The idea is quite simple,
implement learning projects in different languages.
Then, take notes about what you learnt in `notes.md`,
and finally, compare the difference between them
and do different approachs to resolve the same problem/challenge.

## Installation
Just clone this repository, and install [Arturo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo#installation) on your global path.

## Basic

```
./poli new <project>
```
